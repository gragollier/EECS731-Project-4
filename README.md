# EECS 731 - Project 4
*Grant Gollier*

## Overview

The goal of the project was to predict NFL scores for both teams in a given matchup. Overall, the regression models I created performed decently, especially the `Ridge` and `XGBoost` models. To see more information please look at the [1-Regression Notebook](notebooks/1-Regression.ipynb). The trained models are stored in the [models directory](models/).

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis came from the [FiveThirtyEight NFL Elo Dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/nfl-elo-game/tree/master/data).
